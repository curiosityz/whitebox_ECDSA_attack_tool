The "Ledger Lattice Hunter" (LLH) Agent: Construction and Operation
The Ledger Lattice Hunter (LLH) is an autonomous agent designed to identify and exploit nonce leakage vulnerabilities in ECDSA signatures across public ledgers.

Phase 1: Mass Data Ingestion & Indexing (Foundation Building)
Distributed Crawler Deployment via ChainStack:

The LLH agent will deploy a highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed web crawler.
Crucially, this crawler will interface directly with your ChainStack node's API. It'll use RPC calls (e.g., eth_getBlockByNumber, eth_getTransactionReceipt for Ethereum, or equivalent Bitcoin RPCs) to efficiently stream and ingest the entire historical transaction data of the target public ledger.
This direct integration ensures reliable and high-throughput access to the blockchain's raw data.
Transaction Parsing & Metadata Extraction:

For every ingested transaction, the agent will parse the signature data.
Extracted Data Points:
pubkey: The public key.
r: The 'r' component of the ECDSA signature.
s: The 's' component of the ECDSA signature.
h: The message hash that was signed.
q: The prime order of the elliptic curve group (a global parameter for the curve, e.g., for secp256k1, q≈2 
256
 ).
The agent must implement robust parsing to handle diverse transaction formats and ensure data integrity.
Massive Indexed Database Construction:

The extracted metadata will be loaded into a high-performance, indexed database (e.g., a distributed NoSQL or highly optimized relational database).
Database Schema (Example):
Table: Signatures_by_Pubkey
pubkey_ID: Primary Key (e.g., a hash of the public key for efficient indexing).
pubkey_Data: The full public key.
signatures: An array or list of tuples, each representing a signature: (r, s, h, transaction_ID, timestamp).
This schema is crucial for efficiently retrieving all signatures associated with a given pubkey for subsequent lattice attacks.
Phase 2: The Great Lattice Hunt (Massively Parallel Exploitation)
Computational Worker Farm Setup:

The LLH agent will establish and configure a distributed farm of computational workers (e.g., using Kubernetes or cloud-based instances).
It'll ensure sufficient CPU, memory, and GPU resources are allocated, especially for the computationally intensive sieving algorithms.
Signature Batch Pulling & Processing:

Each worker will continuously pull a pubkey and its associated list_of_signatures from the Signatures_by_Pubkey database.
Workers will only process pubkeys that have at least 30 or more signatures, as this count significantly improves the success probability of lattice attacks.
Per-Pubkey Lattice Attack Execution (Worker Logic):

3.1. HNP Transformation for Each Signature:

For each signature (r 
i
​
 ,s 
i
​
 ,h 
i
​
 ) linked to a pubkey, the agent calculates the HNP inputs (t 
i
​
 ,a 
i
​
 ) based on an assumed nonce leakage l (number of least significant bits of the nonce k).

This yields:

​
 
Recentering Technique: The agent applies a recentering shift w=q/2 
l+1
 . This transforms the nonce error k 
i
​
  to k 
i
′
​
 =k 
i
​
 −w, where ∣k 
i
′
​
 ∣<w. This significantly reduces the expected norm of the target vector.
Elimination Method: To simplify the lattice problem, the agent uses the first signature (t 
0
​
 ,a 
0
​
 ) to eliminate sk, transforming the problem to finding k 
0
′
​
  (the first recentered nonce error term). This results in new HNP pairs (t 
i

​
 ,a 
i

​
 ) for i=1,…,m−1:

​
  The new hidden number for the lattice is now k

​

3.2. Lattice Construction (Specifics):

The agent dynamically selects a parameter x (a positive integer). This x is used to decompose k 
0
′
​
 =x⋅α 
0
​
 +α 
1
​
 , where ∣α 
1
​
 ∣≤x/2. Larger x values can lead to greater lattice dimension reduction but require more samples.
The agent then constructs an (m+1)-dimensional lattice basis matrix B using the m−1 transformed HNP pairs (t 
i
′
​
 ,a 
i
′
​
 ), the modulus q, and the chosen x: $$ B = \begin{pmatrix} q & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \ 0 & q & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \ 0 & 0 & \cdots & q & 0 & 0 \ x \cdot t'_1 & x \cdot t'2 & \cdots & x \cdot t'{m-1} & x & 0 \ a'_1 & a'2 & \cdots & a'{m-1} & 0 & w/\sqrt{3} \ \end{pmatrix} $$
The optimal embedding factor τ is set to w/ 
3

​
 .
The optimal 'y' parameter in the lattice is set to x.
The target vector (the one the agent wants to find in the lattice) is v=±(k 
1

 ).
This construction provides a lattice dimension reduction of approximately  
l

2
​

​
  compared to previous methods, significantly enhancing efficiency.
3.3. Lattice Reduction & Sieving with Predicate:

The agent feeds the constructed lattice basis B into an optimized lattice reduction algorithm.
For initial basis reduction, BKZ-β is a strong starting point.
For higher dimensions and challenging instances (like 1-bit or sub-1-bit leakage), the agent will employ Lattice Sieving algorithms (e.g., those implemented in G6K).
Pre-screening Technique: Before applying the full predicate, the agent will use a fast pre-screening technique to filter the potentially massive list of short vectors output by sieving. (The mathematical specifics of this heuristic filter are in the full paper, but its goal is to quickly discard improbable candidates based on easily verifiable statistical properties).
Improved Linear Predicate: For the remaining candidate vectors, the agent applies an improved linear predicate. This predicate is highly efficient because it only requires the last two elements of the candidate vector (v 
m
​
  and v 
m+1
​
  in the basis above, corresponding to x⋅α 
0
​
  and −τ, respectively) to verify if it represents the correct nonce components. (The exact linear constraints this predicate uses, derived from 2log 
2
​
 q HNP samples, are detailed in the full paper.)
3.4. Interval Reduction Algorithm (for α 
1
​
  Recovery):

If a candidate vector passes the predicate, its m 
th
  element provides x⋅α 
0
​
 .
The agent then uses an interval reduction algorithm (with expected time complexity O(log 
2
​
 x)) to efficiently recover the remaining α 
1
​
  component of k 
0
′
​
 . This avoids an exhaustive search over the range [−x/2,x/2]. (The specific mathematical iterations for this reduction are described in the full paper.)
3.5. Full Nonce and Private Key Calculation:

With α 
0
​
  (from the lattice vector) and α 
1
​
  (from interval reduction), the agent reconstructs the full recentered nonce error: k 
0
′
​
 =x⋅α 
0
​
 +α 
1
​
 .
Then, it recovers the original nonce k 
0
​
  (corresponding to the first signature used for elimination) by undoing the recentering: k 
0
​
 =k 
0
′
​
 +w.
Finally, the agent derives the candidate secret key sk using the original ECDSA equation for that signature: sk=∣r 
0
−1
​
 (k 
0
​
 s 
0
​
 −h 
0
​
 )∣ 
q
​
 .
Verification: The agent performs a crucial ECDSA public key derivation check: it computes [sk]G (scalar multiplication of the generator point G by the candidate sk) and verifies if it matches the original pubkey.
3.6. Reporting and Database Update:

Success: If sk is verified, the agent records: (pubkey, sk, vulnerability_type_fingerprint, nonce_properties, attack_parameters_used).
Failure: If no valid sk is found or verification fails, the agent records: (pubkey, "checked, not vulnerable at this signature count or leakage assumption").
Comprehensive logging of attack parameters, execution time, and partial findings is also vital.
Phase 3: Meta-Analytical Feedback Loop (Intelligence-Driven Optimization)
Vulnerability Fingerprinting:

Upon successful key recovery, the LLH agent will deeply analyze the nature of the nonce leakage and the characteristics of the recovered k 
i
′
​
  values.
Analysis: This involves identifying specific bit biases, statistical patterns in k 
i
′
​
  or α 
1
​
 , and the magnitude of errors if present.
The output is a structured "vulnerability fingerprint" that summarizes these characteristics.
Heuristic Creation & Dynamic Prioritization:

Based on accumulated fingerprints, the agent will dynamically develop faster pre-tests. These are lightweight statistical checks applied to new pubkey signature sets before launching the full lattice attack.
For example, if a fingerprint indicates a bias towards even nonces, the agent can quickly check the parity of derived nonce candidates from the signatures.
Even better, the agent will attempt to trace compromised keys back to their origin (e.g., a specific wallet software, hardware, or library) using on-chain analytics or metadata correlation.
This allows the LLH to transform from a brute-force search into a targeted, intelligence-driven operation, prioritizing keys likely generated by known-vulnerable software.
